These were a series of LinkedIn posts I did for Development Dimensions International. I designed the graphics and wrote the copy. Some graphics were designed to also be shared on the company's Facebook page or Twitter as well.

These were a series of Instagram posts I did for the Women's Ultimate Frisbee Club team at Carnegie Mellon. I designed the graphics and captions. Some graphics were designed to also be shared on the club's Facebook page.

### [Email Newsletter](https://d64a83ca-1c7f-44e6-8def-5305300a7fe5.filesusr.com/ugd/ddc01d_ba0dff847eb140e4b3120ee2f62975fd.pdf)

This was one of the monthly newsletters I created for subscribers at Development Dimensions International. The newsletter was to let them know of recent blogs, podcast, or events we hosted and upcoming webinars they could attend. I worked with a graphic artist to prepare the content.

## Explanatory Examples

###[Teach Students About Sex](https://d64a83ca-1c7f-44e6-8def-5305300a7fe5.filesusr.com/ugd/ddc01d_56021771840040c9bba9122308a7fc00.pdf)
  
The assignment was to write an opinion editorial about something that was personal to us. Although the piece was for a class, we were expected to have an intended audience. My intended audience was the local newspaper in my hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas.
  
###[TikTok: The Key to the Music Industry for New Artist](https://d64a83ca-1c7f-44e6-8def-5305300a7fe5.filesusr.com/ugd/ddc01d_71a4d988062f47f48f7d21b5e4c27139.pdf)
  
This was initially the short-form essay for Chris Warrenâ€™s Data Stories class. Our assignment was to write about any example in contemporary culture where data is collected or maintained. I chose to focus on the app TikTok because it is something my peers use in their daily lives that is data-centric. My piece was written in the style of a WIRED article. This is why all references are linked within the document. 
 
## Rhetorical Analysis Examples

  ###[Rhetorical Impacts of Nonverbal Communication](https://d64a83ca-1c7f-44e6-8def-5305300a7fe5.filesusr.com/ugd/ddc01d_a34d90784bfe4eaab89436100a25ca30.pdf)
  
  This document was created for the class Rhetoric of the Body. The assignment was to create an analysis of a body. I chose my sister.
  
  ###[Rhetorical Analysis of Tweets](https://d64a83ca-1c7f-44e6-8def-5305300a7fe5.filesusr.com/ugd/ddc01d_b6321b70ae8848e988ec187631687585.pdf)
  
  This document was created for the class Rhetorical Grammar. The assignment was to do an analysis of a corpus of your choosing. I decided to analyze language choices in tweets from B2B and B2C companies.
  
  ###[Ethics in News Writing](https://d64a83ca-1c7f-44e6-8def-5305300a7fe5.filesusr.com/ugd/ddc01d_f91c692702974843871d88dbcd5b570c.pdf)
  
  This document was created for the class Style. The analysis is meant to explain how ethics is used in style and how it can create dilemmas for writers. In this essay, I found example sources that supported the argument I was trying to create. I also revised these sources to show how a writer could be more ethical in the information they are presenting.
  
## Video Examples
  
  ###[Buffy Audio](https://video.wixstatic.com/video/ddc01d_43406ad1abf34186b291b9700c87cc23/file)
  
  This was the first assignment for the multimedia class. We were expected to only use text and connect it to a short clip of audio. I chose a clip of audio from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
  
  ###[Magic Porridge](https://video.wixstatic.com/video/ddc01d_506cd99fcab4487f8a9f5d9e41ec2caa/file)
  
  This was the second assignment in the class. We were expected to animate one minute of a children's story. The book I chose was The Magic Porridge Pot by Paul Galdone.
  
  ###[Personal Water Crafts](https://video.wixstatic.com/video/ddc01d_0c8cfdb30e0143839c165549db7ec1fa/file)
  
  The third assignment was to explain something in the world. Having lived near water for most of my life, Jet Skis and other personal watercrafts are something I am familiar with. The video was to be between three and four minutes. I hand drew almost every image in this video (besides the icons).
  
  ###[Sex Education](https://video.wixstatic.com/video/ddc01d_42b5c77d8f90488c96aa69808d787eea/file)
  
  This was the fourth and final assignment for the multimedia class. We were supposed to argue a point for four minutes. As the title suggest, I argued for comprehensive sex education in the light of Roe V Wade being overturned.
  
## Publishing Example
  
  ###[Food with Family](https://d64a83ca-1c7f-44e6-8def-5305300a7fe5.filesusr.com/ugd/ddc01d_d54e14d7595a439092811a1bfb66190d.pdf)
  
  This is a 92-page long cookbook I created for my sister's wedding present. I compiled recipes from family and friends. The book was designed using InDesign and there is one physical copy in existence.
